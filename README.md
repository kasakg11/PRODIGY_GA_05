Project Overview
This project applies Neural Style Transfer (NST) to transform images of dogs into artistic styles using deep learning. NST is a technique that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to apply the artistic style of one image (style image) to another image (content image).
Dataset & Input Images
Content Image: A dog image (e.g., a Labrador, Husky, or any other breed).
Style Image: An artistic painting (e.g., Van Gogh's "Starry Night", Picasso’s artwork).
Model Architecture
This project uses a pre-trained VGG19 model to extract feature maps for both content and style images. The model is structured as follows:

Content Feature Extraction: Uses intermediate layers from VGG19 to retain dog image features.
Style Feature Extraction: Captures texture and patterns from the artistic painting.
Loss Functions:
Content Loss: Ensures the output image maintains the dog's structure.
Style Loss: Matches the Gram matrices of the generated image and the style image.
Total Variation Loss: Reduces noise and smooths the image.
Optimization: Uses Adam or L-BFGS optimizer to iteratively update the generated image.
Installation & Setup
To run the project, install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
How to Run the Code in Google Colab
Upload your dog image and style image to Google Colab.
Run the neural_style_transfer.py script:
python neural_style_transfer.py --content_path "dog.jpg" --style_path "starry_night.jpg"
The final stylized image will be saved and displayed.
Results
Below are some examples of Neural Style Transfer applied to dog images:

Content Image	Style Image	Generated Image
Dog Photo 🐶	Starry Night 🎨	Dog in Starry Style ✨
Husky 🐕	Picasso's Art 🖌	Husky in Picasso Style 🎭
Future Enhancements
Implement real-time Neural Style Transfer.
Use GANs (e.g., CycleGAN) for better artistic transformation.
